DESCRIPTION
Cheat sheets that contain a single phrase, formula, or function invocation per
line can be very helpful and are used by many people. Using such as a
completion source is difficult, though. The full line completion
(i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L considers other buffers, but cannot be restricted to a
single one. And to trigger the completion, the base has to be written on a new
line; you cannot recall a phrase from within an existing one. All of this can
be avoided by using a snippet plugin, but the syntax to define them usually is
more complex (so one cannot directly use one's cheat sheet), and the
additional features interfere with easy definition. Also, not every snippet
plugin offers the popup selection aspect of insert-mode completion, so you may
have to remember the snippet name to recall it.

This plugin provides a highly configurable completion of lines found in
designated files or buffers, triggered by a keyword in front of the cursor.
With its flexibility, you can use custom cheat sheets for a project, filetype,
or particular buffer or window as well as global ones.
